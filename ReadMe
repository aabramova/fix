This project uses several technologies: Java, Spring, Maven (to notice dependencies, make war file and deplloy it in Tomcat), Tomcat, JSF, RichFaces (to show folder tree), CSS.
To try this application you should make 2 steps:
  1. In your computer create new folder: C:\newFolder. This folder would be your starting directory, in the application you have an opportunity to change directory.
  2. Download fileserver.war in the target folder and deploy it in Tomcat. You can see application by URL: http://localhost:8080/fileserver. In the left side you can see instruction how to use application.
This aplication has to be developed by several reasons:
  1. Add logs to manage application;
  2. Make an opportunity to not adding 'C:\newFolder'. For example, make root directory like user root directory or another issue.
  3. Apllication build tree very slow if a directory has a lot of folders and files (ex. directory = C:).
  4. Add warning messages or popup panels when user want to delete file/filder or another one.
  5. Add warning message when user change directory to non existing directory or add non existing file.
